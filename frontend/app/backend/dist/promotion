Hi, Hope you're doing well.

I’m reaching out to express interest in contributing to your team. I’ve spent the past several years building real-time business analytics dashboards, AI-powered reporting systems using React, Next.js, FastAPI, Django and AWS. My recent work includes developing high-performance KPI dashboards, automated scorecard pipelines, and ML-enhanced analytics features for companies handling large volumes of customer and marketing data.

I’ve attached my resume for a quick overview of my experience. I’d welcome the chance to bring this experience to your product and help strengthen your data workflows, reporting capabilities, and overall analytics stack. If you’re open to a brief conversation, I would be glad to share more.

David Chen
